Including wenbin wang's EC601 Project

Twitter API: I use this API to get the user's all tweets and get all replys/remove all replys. This function can help me filter the tweets. 
Because if I want to judge whether the person is happy or not, reading his/her replys to other people is useless, we should focus on his or her own tweets.
Thus I write this function. 

Google NLP: I use Google NLP to get text's overall sentiment and analyze all entities in this sentence and get their sentiment separately.
