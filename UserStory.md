The aim of my project is finding the upset people in Twitter and cheer them up.
This project works by extracting the non-reply Twitter from the user recently and put them into Google NLP frame.
I use non-reply twitter because I don't want to get user's reply to other people, because my target is to get the emotion from users and return some sentences of encouragement.
